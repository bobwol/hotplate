DOJO: Are you struggling with your widget's heights?
====================================================

Once you have learned how to master Dojo, you might end up developing a complex application that requires a lot of nested layout widgets.
In terms of layout widgets, you have:

* ContentPane. A pane containing generic contents.
* BorderContainer, StackContainer, TabContainer

The resize() method is used by a widget to do its layout. Resize needs to be called when the widget is visible: if it's not, or if any one of its children is not, resize() will not work.


# Your own widgets

* You need to define resize() for your own widgets -- and call resize() for all the top-lever widgets in them.

# ContentPane

* You need to set the ContentPane size via CSS. Really.
* If a ContentPane contains a single layout widget, it will resize its single child to match its own (unless doLayout was set to false).

# BorderContainer, StackContainer, TabContainer

* They will call resize for their children
