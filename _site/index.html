<p>Hotplate is a framework that allows you to create 201X software in no time. By 201X software I mean software that:</p>

<ul>
<li>allows you to log in using Facebook, Google, Twitter, Oauth1/2, or&#8230; well, login/password pair if you like</li>

<li>available anywhere with a Javascript runtime (see: any modern browser)</li>

<li><em>feels like</em> software, and not like a bunch of web pages</li>

<li>uses a smart client, and a smart server; the smart client is to display information is the most user-friendly possibly way, whereas the smart server is to provide a bunch of secure data stores that are JSON-REST compatible</li>

<li>handles errors (including, and in fact <em>especially</em>, network errors) properly. If anything really bad happens, the application must not stop. Instead, it will tell the user that something network-wise went wrong</li>

<li>has the ability to communicate to your users in different ways: email, SMS, and whatever the world throws at us</li>

<li>shows information <strong>as it changes</strong> to the user. If you have three tabs open, and change your user photo, from one tab, the other two tabs need to see the new photo as well</li>

<li>is written as a bunch of small, maintainable modules</li>
</ul>

<p>I realise that in 202X (that is, 2020 to 2030) writing software will be different. What is cool now, will be taken 100% for granted in 2025. Or maybe Javascript will be dead. I don&#8217;t know, and I frankly don&#8217;t care. I wrote Hotplate because I felt that this is what software <em>should</em> be in 201X &#8211; which is now.</p>

<h1 id='getting_into_it'>Getting into it</h1>

<p>Hotplate is written for Node. It&#8217;s a normal, no-frills Node-based framework. So, before you get into Node, you should know:</p>

<h2 id='core_technologies'>Core technologies</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Javascript. Too many resources to list. The book that got me started was <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1847194141'>Object-Oriented Javascript</a>. I think it&#8217;s great that it covers how constructors and objects work.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href='http://nodejs.org/api/all.html'>NodeJs</a>&#8217;s documentation. Not exactly tutorial style, but I find that actually going through Node&#8217;s own documentation is a great way to actually get to know Node. It starts with a simple, basic web server and then goes through all the nitty-gritty about Node. I personally read it once a month, just to freshen up (you end up using a tiny fraction of what&#8217;s in the docs)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href='http://expressjs.com/'>ExpressJs</a>&#8217;s <a href='http://expressjs.com/guide.html'>guide</a> and <a href='http://expressjs.com/api.html'>API</a>. Express is actually surprisingly simple and small. It doesn&#8217;t actually do <em>that</em> much, what everything it does is really important, and it does it well. It&#8217;s important to understand how middleware plugins work.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='support_libraries'>Support libraries</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href='https://github.com/mercmobily/HTTPErrors'>HTTPErrors</a>. A very simple module that creates constructor functions for every HTTP return code (actually, not just errors).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href='https://github.com/mercmobily/simpleDeclare'>SimpleDeclare</a>. Javascript is a great language, but it lacks a simple way to declare object constructors and inheriting. A lot of node programmers actually do it by hand, writing <code>Class.prototype.someMethod = function(){ ... }</code>. I personally find that absolutely insane. SimpleDeclare solves this problem: it handles (multiple) inheritance, constructor methods, calling of inherited methods, and inheritance of constructor-wide methods. <a href='https://github.com/mercmobily/simpleDeclare/blob/master/declare.js'>SimpleDeclare is really small</a>, but it does everything for you.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href='https://github.com/mercmobily/JsonRestStores'>JsonRestStores</a> (which uses <a href='https://github.com/mercmobily/SimpleSchema'>SimpleSchema</a>). Hotplate is all about stores &#8211; really. JsonRestStores is a fundamental piece here: it allows you to create Json REST stores in no time, dealing with permissions, queries, error management, inherited stores, and so on. You should make yourself comfortable with JsonRestStores <em>while</em> studying Hotplate.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='hotplates_documentation'>Hotplate&#8217;s documentation</h2>

<p>Hotplate comes with comprehensive documentation <strong><span>Note: not yet, documentation is in the works. The statement below are blatantly false</span></strong>. It has:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href='http://www.hotplatejs.com/guide.html'>A comprehensive guide</a>. The guide takes you from absolute zero, to actually knowing what you are doing with Hotplate. It&#8217;s a tutorial-style guide, where you are explained everything step by step.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href='http://www.hotplatejs.com/serverAPI/index.html'>Server API documentation</a>. It documents what each Hotplate module provides, from a server point of view.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href='http://www.hotplatejs.com/clientAPI/index.html'>Client API documentation</a>. It documents what each Hotplate module provides to the clients (for example Dojo widgets).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id='current_status'>Current status:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Authentication: DONE</li>

<li>General code cleanup: DONE</li>

<li>Fixing hotCoreCometMessages for real time comet updates: IN THE WORKS</li>

<li>Write a sample, small application: UPCOMING</li>

<li>Writing the messenging framework: UPCOMING</li>

<li>Wire up the messenging framework with sample application: UPCOMING</li>
