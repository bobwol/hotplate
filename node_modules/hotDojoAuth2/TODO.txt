DAY 1: DONE

DAY 2
* Complete missing bits (client/server) in the Facebook strategy

DAY 3
* Complete missing bits (client/server) in the Local strategy

DAY 4
* Get hotplate to ONLY use hotCoreAuth (!!!) Will need to rewrite 'pick' too

DAY 5
* Figure out how to handle the recovery process, maybe 2 fields in the login info, a hash and an expiry, AND an URL to reset them?
  IDEA. They all create a URL, with a temporary hash. Going to that URL makes the user logged in. Only lasts N minutes. Or, maybe it should
  ask for some security questions first? No, that's for version 2.


DONE:
* Make container widget for MANAGE/signin/register/recover
* Make cookie client side before submit to decide on action when response comes back
* Change redirects so that they check res.redirect( hotplate.get('hotCoreAuth/redirectToFailure/' + )action || '/login' ); 
* Fix names in CSS/divs (status-on and status-off should be ticked/unticked, make a style just for the bg image, take out those -login)
