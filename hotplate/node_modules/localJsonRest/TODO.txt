* Make sure that LocalStorage implements all of the nice things in /home/merc/Synced/Development/Bookings/libs/client/dojo/dojo/store AND
  adds a "name" to the ID for stores

* Write CappedLocalStorage which limits how much is stored by deleting oldest records

* Decide if it's worthwhie (1) inheriting from JsonRest and using CappedLocalStorage as an in-built cache (2) see if dojo.Cache "just works"
  by using CappedLocalStorage
